# Email System - Server

Server side of a scratch built email system. This server is to be used in conjunction with the [client side](https://github.com/redParrot17/emailSystem-client) program.  
This server uses an insanely strong encryption for communicating with the client.
And by strong, I mean signed 256 bit AES in conjunction with a 4096 bit RSA end-to-end encryption :)

Want to use the tcp server/client framework in your own project? You can find the dependency [HERE](https://github.com/redParrot17/redTCP).
